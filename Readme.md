DNS-over-HTTPS
==============

Client and server software to query DNS over HTTPS, using [Google DNS-over-HTTPS protocol](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/dns-over-https)
and [draft-ietf-doh-dns-over-https](https://github.com/dohwg/draft-ietf-doh-dns-over-https).

## Easy start

Install [Go](https://golang.org), at least version 1.9.

First create an empty directory, used for `$GOPATH`:

    mkdir ~/gopath
    export GOPATH=~/gopath
    export GOHOME=/usr/lib/go-1.9/

To build the program, type:

    make

To install DNS-over-HTTPS as Systemd services, type:

    sudo make install

By default, [Google DNS over HTTPS](https://dns.google.com) is used. It should
work for most users (except for People's Republic of China). If you need to
modify the default settings, type:

    sudoedit /etc/dns-over-https/doh-client.conf

To automatically start DNS-over-HTTPS client as a system service, type:

    sudo systemctl start doh-client.service
    sudo systemctl enable doh-client.service

Then, modify your DNS settings (usually with NetworkManager) to 127.0.0.1.

To test your configuration, type:

    dig www.google.com

If it is OK, you will wee:

    ;; SERVER: 127.0.0.1#53(127.0.0.1)

### Uninstalling

To uninstall, type:

    sudo make uninstall

The configuration files are kept at `/etc/dns-over-https`. Remove them manually if you want.

## Server Configuration

The following is a typical DNS-over-HTTPS architecture:

    +--------------+                                +------------------------+
    | Application  |                                |  Recursive DNS Server  |
    +-------+------+                                +-----------+------------+
            |                                                   |
    +-------+------+                                +-----------+------------+
    | Client side  |                                |      doh-server        |
    | cache (nscd) |                                +-----------+------------+
    +-------+------+                                            |
            |         +--------------------------+  +-----------+------------+
    +-------+------+  |    HTTP cache server /   |  |   HTTP service muxer   |
    |  doh-client  +--+ Content Delivery Network +--+ (Apache, Nginx, Caddy) |
    +--------------+  +--------------------------+  +------------------------+

Although DNS-over-HTTPS can work alone, a HTTP service muxer would be useful as
you can host DNS-over-HTTPS along with other HTTPS services.

## DNSSEC

DNS-over-HTTPS is compatible with DNSSEC, and requests DNSSEC signatures by
default. However signature validation is not built-in. It is highly recommended
that you install `unbound` or `bind` and pass results for them to validate DNS
records.

## EDNS0-Client-Subnet (GeoDNS)

DNS-over-HTTPS supports EDNS0-Client-Subnet protocol, which submits part of the
client's IP address (/24 for IPv4, /48 for IPv6 by default) to the upstream
server. This is useful for GeoDNS and CDNs to work, and is exactly the same
configuration as most public DNS servers.

Keep in mind that /24 is not enough to track a single user, although it is
precise enough to know the city where the user is located. If you think
EDNS0-Client-Subnet is affecting your privacy, you can set `no_ecs = true` in
`/etc/dns-over-https/doh-client.conf`, with the cost of slower video streaming
or software downloading speed.

If your server is backed by `unbound` or `bind`, you probably want to enable
the EDNS0-Client-Subnet feature in their configuration files as well.

## Protocol compatibility

### Google DNS-over-HTTPS Protocol

DNS-over-HTTPS uses a protocol compatible to [Google DNS-over-HTTPS](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/dns-over-https),
except for absolute expire time is preferred to relative TTL value. Refer to
[json-dns/response.go](json-dns/response.go) for a complete description of the
API.

### IETF DNS-over-HTTPS Protocol (Draft)

DNS-over-HTTPS uses a protocol compatible to [draft-ietf-doh-dns-over-https](https://github.com/dohwg/draft-ietf-doh-dns-over-https).
This protocol is in draft stage. Any incompatibility may be introduced before
it is finished.

### Supported features

Currently supported features are:

- [X] IPv4 / IPv6
- [X] EDNS0 large UDP packet (4 KiB by default)
- [X] EDNS0-Client-Subnet (/24 for IPv4, /48 for IPv6 by default)
